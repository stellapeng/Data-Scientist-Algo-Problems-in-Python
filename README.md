# Data Scientist Algo Problems in Python

Basic-to-Medium level of algorithm solving skill is playing a more and more important role in Data Scientist work nowadays. But many DS may find it's hard to pick up LeetCode questions, plus, many questions are indeed irrevalent to data analytical work. 

To effectively improve coding skills as a DS, I am summerizing the most revanlent algorithm and data structure problems in this repo with notes. The topic covers Array, Strings, List, Matrix, (binary) Sorting & Searching, Math as well as selected Dynamic Programming problems.

I hope visitors can find this is useful! :raised_hands:
